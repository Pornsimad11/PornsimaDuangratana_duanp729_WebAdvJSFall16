Once when a lion, the king of the jungle, was asleep, {{ vm.user.name }} began running up and down on him. This soon awakened the lion, who placed his huge paw on {{ vm.user.name }}, and opened his big jaws to swallow him.

"Pardon, O King!" cried {{ vm.user.name }}. "Forgive me this time. I shall never repeat it and I shall never forget your kindness. And who knows, I may be able to do you a good turn one of these days!”

The lion was so tickled by the idea of {{ vm.user.name }} being able to help him that he lifted his paw and let him go.

Sometime later, a few hunters captured the lion, and tied him to a tree. After that they went in

 search  of a wagon, to take him to the zoo.

Just then the {{ vm.user.name }} happened to pass by. On seeing the lion’s plight, {{ vm.user.name }} 
ran up to him and gnawed away the ropes that bound him, the king of the jungle.

"Was I not right?" said {{ vm.user.name }}, very happy to help the lion. <a id= "End" href="home">The End</a>
