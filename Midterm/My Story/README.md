## Concept

I want to encourage children to trigger their imagination through text-based content. Since right now everything is displayed through moving image kids are more reluctant to read full text. So I want to create an experience for them to explore in another perspective, another world by themselves. It is through a locked book to make them feel more adventurous and make it feel like a Narnia in their own imagination being part of another world. I replaced character name with their name to make them engage more and be a part of the story. So the idea is I come and change the story everyday to make kids come and read a story a day. 

## What I did 

I do not know how to use MongoDB to create an authenticated register and login function therefore I
used Simon Holmes code from this website. https://www.sitepoint.com/user-authentication-mean-stack/
I designed the interface and created the HTML and CSS to work with his code.

## What did I learn

Following through how he achieved it I get to understand the process and the libraries it need to create a functional login and register and how angular is used to get the data to appear on screen.
